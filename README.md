Android App
==================

The application you will develop will be an Online T-Shirt Provider 
application

# Features

Your finished application will contain three tabbed activities:
1. Screen One is the ‘Welcome’ screen.
2. Screen Two is the ‘Product Menu’ screen
3. Screen Three is the ‘Order T-Shirt’ screen.


# Development Environment

Android App uses the Gradle build system and can be imported directly into the latest stable version of Android Studio (available here). The debug build can be built and run using the default configuration.

Once you're up and running, you can refer to the learning journeys below to get a better understanding of which libraries and tools are being used, the reasoning behind the approaches to UI, testing, architecture and more, and how all of these different pieces of the project fit together to create a complete app.

NOTE: Building the app using an M1 Mac will require the use of Rosetta. See the following bug for more details.
